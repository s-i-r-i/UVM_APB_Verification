# UVM_APB_Verification
HVL: System Verilog
TB Methodology: UVM
EDA Tool: Questasim
Description: Verified the APB FSM Which Consist of Idle(psel=0, penalble=0), Setup(psel=1, penalble=0) and
Access(psel=1, penalble=1) state and done master to same slave and different Slave communication and understaood
the importance of Pready signal.
Responsibilities:
• Architected the class based verification environment in UVM.
• Defined Verification Plan/Feature Extraction Sheet
• Verified the RTL module with UVM Test Bench with different test scenarios like Write Operation with and
without Wait states, Read Operation with and without Wait states, Communication with same slave, Com-
munication with Different Slave, Implemented Testcase with Different Data and addr types like random, user
pattern, constant, increment, decrement and Tested with Write operation, read operation and back to back write
and read operation with 20 transactions.
• Generated functional and code coverage for the RTL verification sign-off.
• Written the assertions for few conditions like reset, write and read operations, setup and access state and so on
